# deep-learning-notes
4 self-learning and practice
##Since deeplearning is just a tool rather than a job for me, I will start from the most basic code and notes at the beginning, and record them bit by bit. I also hope that the repository on GitHub can witness my growth in deeplearning, and I will redouble my efforts to keep up with many excellent workers. And keep up with The Times.
